1. Incident commander name: Joel Mbiye

2. Executive Summary of what happened:
Three pods running three different crypto miners were launched.
The payload was Monero crypto-mining containers, specifically moneropool, minergate and cryptonight.

3. Summary of what was affected:
The attacker was able to get control of the cluster and run these containers on the cluster.
As we all know, attackers are after compute resources to abuse for crypto-mining.

4. Summmry of the impact:
The attacker managed to run crypto miners on our system, which is undesirable. Usually, crypto-mining consumes a lot of CPU. 
On the Grafana dashboard, we can notice that there has been a significant spike in CPU utilization due to crypto miners being started.

5. Summary of the remediation steps:
To remediate, the administrator can run the following command to evict the pods: kubectl --kubeconfig kube_config_cluster.yml delete pod <pod_name> --grace-period=0 --force
We can check back on the Grafana dashboard to notice the decrease in CPU utilization.

6. Summary of lessons learned:
We should review access to the Kubernetes API server from administrative terminals and the Grafana dashboards. 
Admission controllers can also be configured to disallow unknown images to be used to create containers.
